Data compression -----




If any one message is shortened by an algorithm, them some other message
needs to be lengthened.

For a set of messages of fixed length, if one message is compressed, then
the average length of the compressed messages over all possible inputs
is always going to be longer than the original input messages.

Consider, for example, the 8 possible 3 bit messages. If one is 
compressed to two bits, then two messages will have to expand to 4 bits, 
giving an average of 3 (1/8) bits.

2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8

2^2 - 1 = 2
2^3 - 1 = 2
